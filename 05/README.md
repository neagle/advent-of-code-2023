Just reading today's gave me a headache. But the solution to part one ended up
coming very quickly/easily once I was able to get my bearings on the general
problem. I liked using reduce to funnel the initial seed number through the list
of maps to result in a single output. Usually I accumulate stuff with reduce,
just having it get transformed was a fun variation.

Part two was only complicated in that I don't really know how to solve this
other than brute-forcing my way through the range of seeds. That obviously takes
a while, but with the input we were given, it was manageable... it too my
computer maybe 10 minutes. Curious if there's a more elegant solution.
