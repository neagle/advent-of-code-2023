Bah, today's is just math. *grumblegrumblegrumblegrumble*

I also debatably cheated. I don't think I exactly did, because I figured out on
my own that I should think about the distance covered as an equation that had a
graph, then I figured out that there had to be two solutions (amounts of time to
press the button) for any given result, and then I remembered that I was pretty
confident that's what the quadratic equation was for.

I started clumsily putting the numbers I knew (race time, result, record time)
into equations and rearranging them, but I had to get ChatGPT to help me put my
equation into the proper form to be plugged into the quadratic equation.

Then it turns out that part 2 was purely about punishing anyone who thought they
could figure out part 1 through brute force.
