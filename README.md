# Advent of Code 2023

Each day has a folder, and in each folder are two folders for each of the puzzles. My code is written in JavaScript and meant to be used with Deno. To run the scripts locally, have Deno installed and run this command from within the folder:

```sh
deno run --allow-read=. index.js
```

Each puzzle's index file contains the text of the puzzle, along with the provided input.
